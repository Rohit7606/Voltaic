# Project Report: Voltaic - EV Journey Intelligence Platform

**Date:** February 19, 2026
**Status:** Works in Progress (Active Development)

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Voltaic is a specialized route planning application engineered for Electric Vehicle (EV) owners in India. It addresses the critical gap in existing navigation tools by providing physics-based range predictions that account for thermal degradation, elevation changes, and vehicle specific characteristics. The project is currently in the active development phase, with core routing and physics engines implemented.

## 2. Problem Statement

Generic navigation apps (Google Maps, Apple Maps) calculate routes based on distance and traffic time. For EVs, the shortest route is often not the most efficient.
*   **Range Anxiety:** Official range estimates (ARAI) are often 30-40% higher than real-world performance.
*   **Elevation Impact:** A 600m climb (like Mumbai-Pune via Ghats) can consume 3x more energy than a flat road.
*   **Thermal Impact:** Indian summers (>40°C) significantly reduce battery efficiency due to AC load and battery chemistry.

## 3. The Solution

Voltaic solves this by replacing simple distance/time calculations with a **Physics-First Approach**:

1.  **Vehicle Modeling:** We don't just use "average consumption". We model Drag Coefficient ($C_d$), Frontal Area ($A$), Mass ($m$), and Rolling Resistance ($C_{rr}$).
2.  **Environmental Awareness:** The routing engine queries elevation data every 1km and adjusts consumption based on road gradient.
3.  **Thermal Penalty:** A custom algorithm applies energy penalties based on ambient temperature forecasts along the route.

## 4. Technical Architecture

The application is built on a modern, type-safe stack designed for performance and reliability.

### 4.1 Core Stack
*   **Frontend:** Next.js 16 (App Router) for server-side rendering and performance.
*   **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL) with **PostGIS** extensions for efficient spatial queries (finding chargers within x radius).
*   **Type Safety:** End-to-end type safety using TypeScript, Zod for validation, and Drizzle ORM for database interactions.

### 4.2 Key Architectural Decisions
*   **Server Actions:** We use Next.js Server Actions instead of traditional API routes to reduce latency and ensure strict type alignment between client and server.
*   **Self-Hosted Elevation:** To avoid rate limits and high latency, we self-host an instance of OpenElevation, reducing altitude query times from ~2s to <100ms.
*   **Hybrid State Management:**
    *   **Server State:** TanStack Query handles data fetching and caching.
    *   **Client State:** Zustand manages local interactive state (like the ongoing simulation parameters).

## 5. Key Innovations

### 5.1 The Physics Engine
The core of Voltaic is a deterministic physics engine located in `src/lib/physics`. It calculates energy consumption ($E$) for each route segment using:

$$E_{total} = (F_{aero} + F_{roll} + F_{grade}) \times d$$

Where:
*   $F_{aero} = \frac{1}{2} \rho C_d A v^2$ (Air Drag)
*   $F_{grade} = mg \sin(\theta)$ (Gravity/Gradient)

### 5.2 Trust Score™ Algorithm
Unlike other planners that give a binary "Go/No-Go", Voltaic calculates a **Trust Score (0-100%)** for every prediction.
*   **High Quality Data (Score +):** Recent weather data, high-resolution elevation points.
*   **Low Quality Data (Score -):** Estimated traffic, outdated charger status.

This gives the user a transparent understanding of how reliable the prediction is.

## 6. Future Roadmap

*   **Mobile Application:** PWA and Native wrappers for in-car use.
*   **User Accounts:** "My Garage" feature to save custom vehicle configurations.
*   **Community Data:** Crowdsourced real-world consumption data to refine the physics models.
